### **Deposit Campaign Analysis and Optimization** ðŸ“ˆ

**Project Overview**

This project aims to enhance the success rate of customer deposit campaigns by 25% in the next quarter through comprehensive data analysis of previous campaigns. By leveraging these insights, we will develop targeted marketing strategies to boost customer deposits.

### **SMART Framework Identification** ðŸŒŸ

To ensure our objective is clearly defined and achievable, we utilize the SMART framework:

- **Specific:** Increase the success rate of deposits after campaigns by conducting a comprehensive analysis of previous campaign results.
- **Measurable:** Increase the success rate of long-term deposit campaigns by 25%.
- **Achievable:** Based on the results of the previous quarter's deposit campaign, it is feasible to increase the customer deposit rate by 25%.
- **Relevant:** Analyzing the results of previous campaigns can help formulate new strategies to increase deposits in the upcoming campaign.
- **Time Bound:** Increase the success rate of adding customer deposits in the next quarter by implementing strategies derived from the analysis of previous campaign data.

### **Problem Statement** ðŸŽ¯

Increase the success rate of the deposit campaign in the next quarter by 25% through analyzing data from previous campaigns.

### **Defining the Problem** ðŸ“Š

To achieve our objective, we need to address several key questions through data analysis:

1. **Age Range Analysis:** What is the age range of customers who are likely to make long-term deposits?
2. **Occupation Influence:** How does a customer's occupation influence their decision to subscribe to term deposits?
3. **Optimal Campaign Timing:** Which month is suitable for the next campaign?
4. **Impact of Previous Campaigns:** How do the results of previous marketing campaigns affect customers' decisions to subscribe to term deposits?
5. **Balance Influence:** Does a customer's balance influence their likelihood to make long-term deposits?
6. **Marital Status Correlation:** What is the relationship between a customer's marital status and the likelihood of making term deposits?
7. **Education and Balance Comparison:** How does education level compare to account balance in relation to the likelihood of making term deposits?
8. **Age and Last Contact Duration:** How do age and the duration of the last contact compare to the likelihood of making term deposits?
9. **Age and Balance Correlation:** What is the correlation between age and balance for targeting customers in the next deposit campaign?

By addressing these questions, we can uncover actionable insights that will inform our campaign strategies.

### **Data Source** ðŸ“Š

The dataset used for this analysis can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/seanangelonathanael/bank-target-marketing/data). This dataset contains information about marketing campaigns, including data on customer demographics, behaviors, and previous campaign outcomes.

### **Visualization and Analysis Tool** ðŸ“ˆ

To effectively analyze and visualize the data, we use Tableau. Tableau is a powerful data visualization tool that allows for interactive, insightful analysis. You can access our Tableau dashboard [here](https://public.tableau.com/shared/MDZDNXN5H?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

Through this structured approach, I aim to develop data-driven strategies that will significantly enhance the success rate of deposit campaigns. ðŸš€

Based on the data analysis, adjusting the next campaign according to the findings can potentially increase the likelihood of customers making deposits by 25%, up from the initial 3.34%. The data indicates that campaigns conducted in May receive significant customer attention. The target demographic will focus on customers aged between 33 to 48 years old. Comparing several factors such as balance, occupation, last contact duration, and marital status:

- Customers with larger balances are highly likely to make term deposits.
- Customers with permanent jobs are more inclined to take term deposits.
- Active and reachable customers are highly likely to be interested in term deposits through the campaign.
- Married customers are significantly more likely to take term deposits based on the data. ðŸ’¼ðŸ’°
